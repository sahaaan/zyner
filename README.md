# YC Startup Directory Scraper

A Python scraper that extracts data for approximately 500 startups from Y Combinator's startup directory.

**Approach:**
I discovered that YC's directory uses **Algolia Search API** to serve company data, which allowed for efficient bulk retrieval instead of complex HTML pagination. The scraper works in two phases: (1) fetch company listings via Algolia API, then (2) scrape individual company pages asynchronously to extract founder names and LinkedIn URLs from `ycdc-card` HTML elements.

**Roadblocks Faced:**
1. **Dynamic Content** - The YC directory loads companies via JavaScript/Algolia. Solved by directly querying the Algolia API endpoint.
2. **Founder Name Extraction** - Initial parsing returned "Unknown Founder" because YC uses custom CSS classes (`text-xl font-bold`) instead of standard heading tags. Fixed by targeting the correct selectors.
3. **False Positives** - Company LinkedIn pages (`/company/`) and company names were being captured as founders. Added filtering to only keep personal LinkedIn profiles (`/in/`).
